/**
 * Facade over the sources game data is read from.
 *
 * Every mount takes an optional bucket. Passing none keeps the source in
 * insertion order, which is what all current
 * callers do; passing one places the source in the raw lookup order instead.
 * Which sources belong in which bucket is a decision for the callers, not for
 * this layer.
 *
 * The two are not mixed: whichever a backend is given first fixes how it
 * orders sources until it is emptied, and mounting across that choice throws
 * ValidationException. A caller migrating to buckets migrates every mount it
 * makes, because an unbucketed source has no position in the raw lookup order
 * to be ranked at.
 *
 * Every mount also takes an owner, which says what retires the source. Owner
 * and bucket are independent: clearing an owner never reorders what remains,
 * and a bucket never implies a lifetime.
